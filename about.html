            <h1>Hello,</h1>
            <h2>A bit about Tori:</h2>
            
            <img id="tori" src="images/tori.jpg" alt="about Tori" width="200" height="266">
            <p>Tori worked as an apprentice for over nine years before striking out to open Pups Parlor. A large number 
                of clients followed her to her new location, and today she finds she has to book weeks ahead due to the 
                demand. Recently she was devastated when she had to turn away some work due to her demand. But 
                don’t let that stop you from asking. She can usually find a slot somewhere.</p><br>

            <p>At home Tori raises four kids, the oldest one in college and the youngest just four years old and with a 
                neurological condition that requires special needs. Fortunately, her husband pitches in and cares for the 
                kids allowing Tori to do her magic at the shop.</p><br>

            <p>If there is one thing people say most about Tori it is that she genuinely cares about her clients and their 
                pets. Her ready smile and positive attitude is infectious, both to her two-legged and four-legged clients. 
                Her focus is on her furry clients from the moment she meets them. </p><br>

            <p>Some dogs do not like being examined or having toenails cut, and other procedures. They growl and 
                threaten. Asked if she has ever been bitten Tori say’s luckily not. She is as gentle as a lamb with them, 
                but if they challenge her, she seems to have a magical way to let them know this is happening, and they 
                back down. Like a magician, no one knows how she does it.</p><br>
            <img id="tori2" src="images/tori2.jpg" alt="about Tori2" width="200" height="264">
            <p>Tori is quick to help owners develop the best habits in brushing and caring for their dogs’ coats to keep 
                them looking their best. She says it’s a bit of a self-defense mechanism, making her job even easier (and 
                less costly) when they come in to see her, but also helps proud moms and dads keep that groomed look 
                going. If other people remark “what a beautiful dog,” when a client is out and about, that’s what brings 
                a smile to Tori’s face. But then, it doesn’t take much to bring a smile to her face. That seems natural for 
                her.</p>
