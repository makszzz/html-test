            <h2>Our Services</h2>
            <p>A professional grooming session typically consists of the dog being brushed, bathed, and dried, as well as trimmed or clipped with clean, sanitized brushes and clipper blades. Groomers brush or comb out mats before the bath, making it easier to lather the dog with shampoo.</p>

                <p>The cost generally runs between $40 and $115, depending on several factors.<br><br>
                    The biggest impact on cost is the dog's size and the length and thickness of the coat  It comes down to how long it's going to take to groom your dog—the more fur, the more work.

                <h2>The Grooming Process</h2>
                <h3>How is it working?</h3>
            
                    <dt>Step 1: Prep</dt>
                    <dd>Once we've got an idea of "the look" you want for your pet we start on the basics or the "prep". We clean your pet's ears and pluck the hair from them if necessary this helps prevent and combat potential or existing infection. The last step in this preparation process is to brush your dog and give them a "rough-cut".</dd><br>

                    <dt>Step 2: Bath</dt>
                    <dd>We have multiple methods used for bathing, depending on the requirements of your particular pet. Our bathing systems ensures that the soapy water solution gently powers right down to the skin--for a truly clean pooch. You have your choice of just a "regular, clean-em-up" shampoo or you can choose from a variety of specialty shampoo treatments like Oatmeal, Aloe, etc. to sooth, moisturize, or treat special skin conditions. Additionally you are welcome to provide your own shampoo and/or conditioner that better suits you and your dog needs.</dd><br>

                    <dt>Step 3: The Blow Dry</dt>
                    <dd> After thoroughly rinsing your pet, we blow the hair dry using a hand held dryer, more powerful than the normal hair dryer. This serves to speed up the drying process. It also helps remove excess dander, undercoat or dead hair that remains after the bath. It aids the fluffing-up of curly coated dogs, straightens longer coats and, for double-coated dogs (or super-shedding breeds), is crucial in helping to get the coat ready for the final process. Certain sensitive areas such as the ears, paws, and face are primarily excluded from this hand-drying process to reduce the stress on the animal. Once, we've gotten your pooch about 80% dry we carefully set them up under our stand dryers that help get those sensitive areas dry for the grooming process.</dd><br>

                    <dt>Step 4: The Final Step</dt>
                    <dd>Once your pup is clean and dry, they are set to go through the "FINISHING PROCESS". For short-haired pets, this simply means a final brush out and nail trim. For longer coats or dogs that require haircuts, this process sometimes involves even more brushing and then the final, polished haircut to detail the specifications you give us during check-in. Additionally this is when we trim the toenails and the hair that grows on the bottom of the feet—this can help combat a potential infection of the pads. At The Dog Wash we save the nails for last as to minimize the stress that your pet undergoes.</dd><br>
